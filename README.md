# cloud_db_mgmt_pooling_migrations
Working with Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to manage a cloud-based MySQL database with a focus on implementing connection, pooling and performing database migrations

## Database Schema
I have defined two classes Patient and MedicalRecord for a relational database schema. The relationships between the tables can be visualized in the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). In the ERD diagram screenshots for both Azure and GCP databases, you can observe the connections between the patients and medical_records tables, both linked to the patient ID number in the patient table.
